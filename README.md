# SemApps

SemApps means Semantic Apps. 

It is a collaborative, interoperable, generic and modular knowledge management system and semantic web application framework, compliant with several specifications: LDP, Solid, SPARQL, ActivityPub, WAC, OIDC. 

Based on linked data & semantic web technologies, it allows the co-production of knowledge graphs.
Built on open standards, it enables the development of interoperable information systems.
Designed on a modular architecture, it gives everyone the opportunity to build and customize platforms on demand. Thanks to its micro-service architecture, it is easy to extend it with your own business logic.

Its code is released under the Apache 2.0 free license.


It uses [moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) for the micro-service framework, and [Jena fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) as triplestore. It is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/semapps/repositories).

Semapps comes with a default frontend based on React-admin, and some Vuejs and D3.js projects have been developed too on top of semapps, for graph visualisations.
